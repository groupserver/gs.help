      <h1>Keeping Track of Conversations</h1>
      <p>
        Often, you do not wish to read every post in an online group, but you do
        want to keep track of the conversation. The simplest way to do this is 
        to glance at the subject and sender information, and then 
        <a href="#delete-the-emails">delete the emails</a>. You can usually tell
        what is being discussed in the group without reading every post, 
        especially if members 
        <a href="contribute.html#contribute-write-good-subject-lines">write good subject lines</a>.
        You can always go to the web interface to read the conversations in 
        detail. If you prefer not to use this method, you can 
        <a href="#filter-the-emails">filter the emails</a> or 
        <a href="#topic-digest">use the topic digest</a> or 
        <a href="#web-feed">a web feed</a>
        to keep track of the conversations.

        <h2>Delete the Emails</h2>
        <p>
          You may receive a lot of email via your Online Group. The point of 
          this is to increase communication but to do so effectively. You 
          should be able to tell whether a post is relevant to you or not just
          by reading the subject line. If it isn't relevant, you have still
          gained information about what is going on in the group. If you do 
          open and skim or read the email, you can then delete it, unless you 
          want to respond to or act on it. You don't need to worry about 
          finding it again later, because you can always go to the Topics area 
          of the group to locate it.

        <p>
          Some people find it useful to keep all of the posts from an online
          group in a separate email folder. 
          You can even set up a rule or filter to put them there automatically. 
          If you prefer, you can delete the emails from your Inbox as you
          receive them and read them in the Topics area when you  are ready.

          title, number of posts, date of the last post, and location of the 
          topic on the web are displayed. The digest is sent once per day so 
          long as there is activity in the group, or once per week if there is
