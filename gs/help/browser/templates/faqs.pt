        <p>
          Go to your <a href="/p/">Profile</a>, and click Change Email
          Settings page.  
          On this page you can add or remove email addresses. To add an
          email address, type your email address into the 'Add Address'
          field and click the 'Add' button.

        <h2>How do I delete a post? How do I delete a file?</h2>
        <p>
          You can not delete a post or file but you can hide a post 
          and the files associated with it. To hide post, visit 
          the post on the web and click the "hide" button.
          
          Keep in mind that messages sent by email can not be withdrawn.
          
          The files that are linked to in the email version of a post
          that has been hidden will, however be hidden.

        <h2>
          When I send an email to my Online Group, I receive an email telling

        <p>
          Your email account might be configured such that your outgoing
          messages are sent from an email address slightly different from
          the one at which you receive messages.
          If so, the system will not recognise your sent emails.
          If the rejected address mentioned in the email is not listed on
          your Change Email Settings page then you will need to add it:
          <a href="/p">visit your profile</a>, 
          click <samp>Change Email Settings</samp>, and
          add the email address.
        </p>

        <h2>
          I sent an email to my group
          Why hasn't it appeared in the Topics section of my group?
        </h2>
        <p>
          First, check that the message was sent to the Online Group. 
          If it was, you will have received a copy of your own message.
          It will have a shortened version of the Online Group name in the
          subject line (e.g. [groupname]).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you got the message and it is not in the Topics section of the
          Online Group on this website, please
          <a class="email" title="Email support"
             tal:attributes="href string:mailto:${view/siteInfo/get_support_email}">contact us</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If you did not receive the message, check to make sure the email
          address you sent it to was correct.
          Also check that the email address you sent the message from is
          registered to your profile.
          You can do this by visiting <a href="/p">your profile,</a>
          and clicking <samp>Change Email Settings</samp>.
