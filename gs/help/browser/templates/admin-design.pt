      <h1>Design of Online Groups</h1>
      <p>
        When a site administrator starts an online group, there are
        some decisions to be made. Those decisions affect the way 
        that group members will perceive and participate in the 
        online group. It is worth taking care over those decisions.
        This guide will help you to think about how to set up your
        online group so that it is likely to be successful.
      </p>
      <p>
        When starting a group, the site administrator will
        have to make decisions on the following features of 
        the online group.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        	<a href="#name">Name</a>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<a href="#id">Identifier</a>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<a href="#privacy">Privacy Setting</a>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<a href="#description">Short Description</a>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<a href="#prefix">Subject Line Prefix</a>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<a href="#membership">Membership Criterion</a>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<a href="#about">About the Group</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
        <h2 id="name">Name</h2>
        <p>
          The name is the most important design element of an Online 
          Group. 
          It embodies the essence of the group and, if it works, will 
          become a shared shorthand for everything that the participants 
          know and value about the group.
        </p>
        <p>    
          The name of an online groups should meet the following criteria.
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Compelling</dt>
          <dd>
            The name should be interesting and engaging so that people like it.
            It should be easy to say aloud. 
            Double meanings and humour can be useful for generating 
            catchy names.
          </dd>
          
          <dt>Encompassing</dt>
          <dd>
            The name should encapsulate the people,
            the purpose, the participation and the 
            passion that are planned for the group.
          </dd>

          <dt>Brief</dt>
          <dd>&#9786;</dd>

          <dt>Fitting</dt>
          <dd>
            The should make sense in relation to its context: the site
            on which it resides, and the other groups that reside on that site.
            The name should lend itself to a suitable <a href="#id">identifier</a>. 
          </dd>
        </dl>

      <h2 id="id">Identifier</h2>

        <p>
          The group identifier (or "ID") is used in the email address and 
          web address (or url) of the group. The ID should closely match
          the name of the group but should be all lower case, with no 
          spaces or other characters that are not allowed in an email
          address or url.
        </p>


      <h2 id="privacy">Privacy Setting</h2>

        <p>
          The privacy setting determines who can view posts, 
          join the group and even see the existence of the group.
          A more restrictive privacy setting creates greater
          possibility for trust in the group but makes it harder
          to participate. A more permissive privacy setting 
          makes it easier for people to participate in the group 
          but harder to develop trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          A private or secret group should have a 
          clear <a href="#membership">membership 
          criterion</a>.
        </p>

      <h2 id="description">Short Description</h2>

        <p>
          The short description is shown to group members 
          and people who may join or request to join the group.
          It should summarise the purpose of the group and who
          the group is for.
        </p>

      <h2 id="prefix">Subject Line Prefix</h2>
      
        <p>
          The subject line prefix appears in square brackets
          at the start of the subject line of all posts made
          via the group. It allows group members to easily spot
          posts from the group. The subject line prefix should 
          be short but easily recognised. Often the subject 
          line tag is the same as the <a href="#id">identifier</a>.
        </p>

      <h2 id="membership">Membership Criterion</h2>
            
        <p>
          The membership criterion tells group members
          who may be invited or allowed to join a 
          <a href="#privacy">private or secret group</a>
          in future. Any post that is made to the group
          could in future be read by someone who meets
          the membership criterion.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also important that participants know 
          that they may no longer meet the membership criterion in future, 
          for example if the membership is restricted to current 
          office-holders in a committee.
        </p>   
        <p>
          The membership criterion should be worded in such a way that 
          it can be enforced in an even-handed way in the future.
        </p>   

      <h2 id="about">About the Group</h2>
 
        <p>
          The About the Group section can contain any information 
          that is relevant to the group. It may contain a logo or image, 
          a link to sites relevant to the group. It may contain 
          rules that apply to the group.
        </p>
