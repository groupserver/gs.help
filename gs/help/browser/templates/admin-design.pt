      <h1>Design of Online Groups</h1>
      <p>
        When a site administrator starts an online group, there are
        some decisions to be made. Those decisions affect the way 
        that group members will perceive and participate in the 
        online group. It is worth taking care over those decisions.
        This guide will help you to think about how to set up your
        online group so that it is likely to be successful.
      </p>
      <p>
        When starting a group, the site administrator will
        have to make decisions on the following features of 
        the online group.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        	<a href="#name">Group Name</a>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<a href="#id">Group ID</a>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<a href="#privacy">Privacy Setting</a>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<a href="#description">Short Description</a>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<a href="#prefix">Subject Line Prefix</a>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<a href="#membership">Membership Criterion</a>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<a href="#about">About the Group</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
        <h2 id="name">Group Name</h2>
        <p>
          The name is the most important design element of an Online 
          Group. 
          It embodies the essence of the group and, if it works, will 
          become a shared shorthand for all the participants know and 
          value about the group.
        </p>
        <p>    
          The name should be easy to say and to refer to in email. 
          It should be suitable for use in a url and an email address 
          (probably all in lower case).
          The name can have "full" and "short" versions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The criteria for a name are:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Potency</dt>
          <dd>
            The name should be interesting and engaging so that it 
            communicates a lot of meaning.
            Double meanings and humour can be useful in generating names 
            that are catchy but not overdone.
          </dd>
          
          <dt>Brevity</dt>
          <dd>&#9786;</dd>

          <dt>Accuracy</dt>
          <dd>
            The name should encapsulate or evoke the people, the place,
            the purpose, the participation, and the passion.
          </dd>

          <dt>Fit</dt>
          <dd>
            The name must not clash with any other group.
          </dd>
        </dl>
          <p class="note">
            <strong class="label">Hyphens and Underscores</strong>
            The Internet convention seems to be that underscores are a
            replacement for spaces and hyphens are a separator (perhaps 
            between set and member in set-member). 
            For online group names, either makes sense.
          </p>

      <h2 id="id">Group ID</h2>


        <p>
          All Online Groups are located in a site. 
          Project Owners with multiple Online Groups often have a site of
          their own.
          Where a new site is to be established, a Site Design is required. 
          Where the Online Group is to be located in a site that already 
          exists, or for which a Site Design has been completed, all that 
          is required is to name that site. 
        </p>


      <h2 id="privacy">Privacy Setting</h2>

        <p>
          The boundaries of Online Groups are highly variable. 
          Groups can be very public, very private and have a number of 
          levels of privacy in between those. 
          It is important that the level of privacy is appropriate to the
          requirements for the group and that it is communicated very 
          clearly to the participants.
        </p>

      <h2 id="description">Short Description</h2>

      <h2 id="prefix">Subject Line Prefix</h2>
      
      <h2 id="membership">Membership Criterion</h2>
            
        <p>
          The Membership Definition is the most defined boundary that an 
          Online Group has. 
          It determines who can be in the group.
          The membership must be defined in such a way that 
          it can be implemented in an even-handed way in the future.
        </p>   
        <p>
          It is important that group participants know, not just who is 
          in the group at present, but who might join the group in future. 
          It is also important that participants know 
          that they may no longer meet the membership criterion in future, 
          for example if the membership is restricted to current 
          office-holders in a committee.
        </p>   
        <p>
          Membership is conditional on compliance with the Participation
          Protocol.
        </p>


      <h2 id="about">About the Group</h2>
     

        <h3>Participation Protocol</h3>
        <p>
          The Participation Protocol defines the secondary boundary for 
          the Online Group. 
          It defines "what is OK" in the Online Group. 
          The Membership Definition (the primary boundary) is conditional 
          on compliance with the Participation Protocol.
        </p>

        <h3>Encouraged Participation</h3>
        <p>
          The Encouraged Participation items provide a chance to name 
          the particular kinds of participation that are expected to 
          achieve the purpose for the Participants and the Owner.
