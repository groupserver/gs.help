      <h1>Roles in Online Groups</h1>
      <p>
        Successful Online Groups need people  interacting with each other
        in a variety of roles. All online groups have participants of course.
        But there are other roles that are important. Some roles may not even 
        involve being a member of the group.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is helpful if all participants in an online group know who is in
        each role and what responsibilities they have in their role.
      </p>        
      <p>
        There are no universally accepted definitions for roles in online 
        groups. Here are some role descriptions developed by OnlineGroups.Net.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main roles in an online group are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="#participant">Participant</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#administrator">Administrator</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#owner">Owner</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some <a href="#other">other roles</a> can be important, too.
      </p>

      <h2 id="participant">Participant</h2>
      <p>
        All members of an online group are participants. 
        Participation is voluntary.
        People participate when they perceive some current or future 
        <a href="/help/participation/benefits/">benefit</a> to them in doing so.
        Some participants pay little attention to the group. 
        Others <a href="/help/participation/keep_track">keep
        track of conversations</a> in the group.
        Some <a href="/help/participation/follow_closely/">follow 
        conversations closely</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Active participants 
        <a href="/help/participation/contribute/">contribute to conversations</a>
        in the group. 
        They advance ideas or information, ask and answer questions, add to 
        each other's answers, provide alternative answers and acknowledge each 
        other. Active participants provide the benefit for 
        others to follow conversations. And they encourage others to 
        contribute as well.
      </p>
      <h2 id="administrator">Administrator</h2>
      <p>
        The Administrator has the technical role of adding and removing 
        group members. Often the Administrator also has the social role
        of fostering participation in the group.
      </p>    

      <p>
        It is not possible to make people participate. The Administrator 
        can only initiate and encourage participation in line with the
        purpose of the group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some ways that an Administrator can help to foster participation.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Be the person who is most comfortable participating in the 
          Online Group 
        </li>
        <li>    
          Help other members to become comfortable participating in the Online
          Group.
        </li>
        <li>    
          Welcome new members to the group.
        </li>
        <li>
          Model and encourage effective participation in line with
          the purpose of the group.
        </li>
        <li>    
          Acknowledge the participation of others.
        </li>
        <li>    
          Be a "Keeper of the Faith" who maintains a vision for active and
          valuable participation
          in the Online Group.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be a Curator of the archives, encouraging good use of Topics
          and creating links to valuable Topics in the About section of 
          the group.
        </li>
      </ul> 
      
      <h2 id="owner">Owner</h2>
      <p>
        The Owner is the person or organisation that has commissioned the 
        establishment of the online group for a particular 
        purpose.
        The Owner has the authority to close the Online
        Group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Online Groups are not and can not be democracies. One person 
        always has the Site Administrator's password. It is important that 
        people know who that is and who they are accountable to.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Owner and Administrator may be the same person. If they are not,
        the Administrator is accountable to the Owner.
      </p>

      <h2 id="other">Other Roles in Online Groups</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes people take other roles in online groups.
     </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <strong>Moderator</strong> receives all posts submitted by participants and
          decides whether or not to distribute the posts via the online group
        </li>
        <li>
          A <strong>Subject Matter Expert</strong> shares domain knowledge in 
          the group.
        </li>
      </ul>
