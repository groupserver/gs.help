      <h1>Follow Conversations Closely</h1>
      <p>
        If you are actively involved in an online group, you will probably want 
        to follow the conversations closely. You can do this by reading the 
        emails as they come in, but in busy online groups, it is often easier to
        follow them via the web.

        <p>
          As soon as a post is added to the group, 
          <span tal:content="siteName" /> can send the full text of the post 
          to you as an email message. The subject line contains the group name 
          and the topic title, while the body of the email message 
          contains the full text of the post.

        <h2>Follow a Conversation via the Web</h2>
        <p>
          When there are a lot of posts, it is easier to turn off email and
          follow conversations on the website instead. Posts on <span tal:content="siteName" /> 
          are organized into topics. Each topic is a readable sequence of messages, 
          making it possible to follow several conversations even when they
          are occurring simultaneously.
