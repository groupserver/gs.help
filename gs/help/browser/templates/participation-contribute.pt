        <h2>Write Good Subject Lines</h2>
        <p>
          Accurate subject lines enable group members to identify the 
          topic of an email message before they read it. 
          Subject lines are also used to organize posts on the website into
          readable  sequences known as "topics". 
          Well-organized topics make it possible to follow multiple concurrent
          conversations. 
          It is therefore important to add to existing topics where 
          appropriate, and to write good subject lines when starting new 
          topics.
