        A guide to establishing and supporting successful online groups
      </h2>
      <p>
        Most online groups fail.
        Either no participation occurs at all or the participation that occurs 
        does not achieve the intended purpose of the group.
        The chances that relevant participation will occur can be increased
        by adequate <a href="design.html">design</a> and support and by
        having a clear <a href="roles.html">role</a> for participant 
        in the project. 
        Even with both of these, participation development is often slow.
