User Manual
-----------

The user manual contains step-by-step instructions on how the normal
users of GroupServer (anyone without group administration privileges)
should carry out tasks using the system.

The manual should be useful for normal-users, but the intended audience
is the *developers* of GroupServer. It allows a discussion of a system
without having to write code. When coding, the manual acts as a guide
as to the functionality that should be written. Finally, the help can
be used as a functional test.
